    <h1> Rotating Diversity</h1>
    <div id="conclusion">
      <p> 
        Caltech has long been known not only for its rigorous academic environment
         but for its  close-knit undergraduate community- a staple of the Caltech 
         experience that we owe to the House system. Living in, and being a part 
         of a House is a life-changing experience for many Techers that you won’t
          find in any other college, let alone in the outside world. Houses 
          connect people of all grades, providing a social safety net and an 
          opportunity for new students to learn from old students, all to help
           navigate the confusing and rigorous environment that is Caltech. With
            their traditions and historic spaces, the Houses manipulate space 
            and time to connect students from the past, present, and future.</p> 
        <p>Three days after prefrosh first set foot on campus, they get to know the
         Houses during rotation. By the end of it, the prefrosh rank the Houses 
         in order of preference and the Houses pick a list of particular prefrosh
          they especially want. Then, prefrosh are given their House assignments
           by what students lovingly refer to as “the algorithm”.</p> 
        <p>However, rotation could lead to a reduced amount of diversity within the
         Houses themselves, as it enables students to pick the Houses they get 
         along with the most, and vice versa. Colleges advertise themselves as 
         allowing their students to meet a diverse group of people.
          The <a href="https://registrar.caltech.edu/records/enrollment-statistics" target="_blank" >demographic composition</a> of Caltech as a whole has evolved, reflecting
           societal and institutional efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. 
            However, do these efforts actually result in a more diverse student
             life experience? </p>
          <p>What if Caltech ensured a diverse student life by making sure that each
         House has a diverse population? We already do this to an extent, as we
          try to make each House have the same gender ratio. Though, what about
           other demographic categories like athletes, LGBTQIA+ people, and under
           -represented minorities (URMs)? Should we ensure that these groups 
           are evenly spread throughout the Houses? Would this foster a more 
           diverse college experience, or erode House community and isolate people,
            by putting people in Houses they did not choose?
        </p>
        
        <h3>Creating our Toy Model</h3>
            
        <p>We begin with a population of <b>500 students</b>, representing
        the demographic makeup of Caltech in this four-year instance. We 
        gave three attributes to each student in the population: sports participation, Queer identity, 
        and under-represented minority status.</p>

          <h3> Real-World Housing Choices </h3>
          <p>Universities and other formal organizations have been primarily 
            concerned with <b>structural diversity</b>, otherwise known as the numerical 
            representation of diverse groups admitted to their campuses. In diversity literature, researchers 
            are focused on the impact of <b><i>informal interactional diversity</i></b>. Although 
            these informal interactions with
             diverse peers can occur in many 
            campus contexts, the majority of them occur outside of the classroom. Such 
            interactions are facilitated by the House structure, including informal 
            conversation, daily interactions in residence halls, House events, 
            and casual social activities.</p>
          <p>
            In the current housing system, specific Houses tend to have more of 
            one population in them than others. For instance, most of the athletes
             tend to end up in one House. The Houses may also differ in terms of 
             underrepresented minority, international status, or if they identify
              as queer or not.</p> 
            
            <p>For the sake of this toy model, we are assuming that certain groups 
            will tend to pick one House over the others. </p>
<!--             
            <h3>Equalized</h3> 
            <p>The rotation algorithm makes some effort to equalize the proportion 
            of male to non-male individuals in each House. What if quotas like 
            this one were instated for other categories?  -->
            <!-- </p> -->
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <h3> Determining Self-Selection in our Toy Model </h3>
            <p>
            Then for each individual, we generated a “House ranking,” which is
             what we assume the individual would have ranked the Houses.For instance, if someone’s ranking is C, A, D, B, then C is their most preferred house,
             while B is their least preferred.  </p>
            <p> The ranking is based on what groups they were a part of. So, 
              if someone plays a sport, then they will rank
              House A first. If they are an URM, then they will rank B first. If they are 
              queer then they will rank C first. 
            <p>If someone belongs to multiple groups, then they rank the Houses associated with
            those groups first, the order of which is random. They will rank the rest of the
              Houses below those groups.</p> 
           <p>For example, if a student is an athlete and queer, then they will rank A and C before B and 
            D. So, some possible rankings they could submit are: (A, C, B, D) or  (C, A, D, B);
            etc. </p>
          <p>Next, we <i>rotated</i> the population!
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step" data-step="1">
          <h3> Our Rotation Algorithm </h3>
          <p>
            To rotate the individuals, we needed to create an algorithm that 
            would maximize assigning people to their high priority house picks,
            while keeping the number of people in each house the same. This 
            problem is similar to the stable marriage problem which uses the
              Gale-Shapley algorithm, but with an added constraint of keeping
              house sizes balanced. This algorithm is what matches medical students 
              with residencies!

            <h3>Self-Selection of Athletes</h3>
            <p>Caltech has had student-athletes since 1893 with 16 current 
              intercollegiate teams and is a member of the NCAA Division III. However, 
              within the last decade, the proportion 
              of athletes among the undergraduate student body has increased to <b>over
               25%</b>. This was due to an increasing role of athletics in admissions,
                which informs our toy model's proportion of athletes as well as 
                our self-sorting algorithm. However, according to a 2024 article in
                the Tech, Caltech faculty stated that:</p>
                <blockquote class="highlight-quote">
                  <q>The preference that was given to athletes over the last few
                     years will be gradually diminished, such that admissions 
                     will be based solely on academic merit and excellence.</q>
                </blockquote>
 
               <p>This will have lasting impacts on Caltech's
                athletic population, among decreasing the number of student-athletes 
                on campus. Using our toy model, we visualized how 
                student-athletes are currently distributed among the Houses. We 
                speculate this distribution influences their academic and social well-being, 
                community cohesiveness, and belongingness. 
              </p>
              
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <h3> Balancing Athlete Distribution</h3>
            <p>We operated under the assumption that athletes gravitated towards
               other athletes, which led to House A having about 90% of the 
               school's student-athletes, as shown by the dot visual on the
                left. Clicking through the button shows how the athlete versus
                 non-athlete distribution among the Houses is uneven. 
              </p>
              <p>In the case of the current distribution where students self-select
                into Houses, then the students involved in sports may report higher
                 levels of stress but also stronger social connections within their
                  Houses. Sports team participation informs active culture (through
                   attending House dinners, trips, meetings, etc), along with daily 
                   schedule and noise level, especially at night. On average, 
                   Caltech student-athletes sleep earlier and wake up much earlier 
                   than the average non-athlete. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <h3> Balancing Under-represented Minority Distribution</h3>
            <p> Under the same assumption, under-represented minority (URM) groups would gravitate
              towards each other. In our toy model, we set 15% of the population to be
              URMs, with a majority of them self-selecting into House B.
              </p>
              <p>Over the years, the demographic composition of Caltech has evolved greatly, 
                reflecting societal changes and institutional efforts to promote diversity
                and inclusion.</p>

            <h3> Balancing LGBTQIA+ Distribution</h3>
            <p> We set 10% of our model population to be
              queer, with a majority of them self-selecting into House C.
              </p>
              <p>Being a member of the queer community could inform hobbies, 
                music, and the types of House culture and social events being
                organized.

            <p>Here, if you hover over each of the nodes in the causal diagram, 
              you can increase or decrease their quantity and observe how they 
              detract or improve other aspects of students' environment. There are
              far-reaching implications for spreading out Caltech's athletes among
              the Houses. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <h3>Life-Style Factors</h3>
              <p>In our speculative model, having less student-athletes 
                will increase their isolation due to being the minority in terms 
              of sleep and work schedule and exercise lifestyle. For example, a
               different sleep schedule can cause potential tension between an 
               athlete and non-athlete. It also affects the rest of the time 
               they have outside of sports to spend in the House socializing 
               with other non-athletic students. Less bonding time weakens their 
               relationship to their Housemates, as well as their want to contribute
                towards the House community. A positive feedback loop forms as 
                the more isolated they become, the harder it is for the athletes
                 to become connected to their community.

                  engage with more complex ideas. This leads to more innovative research,

               no growth (and sometimes even slight declines) in leadership skills,

              <p> On the otherhand, one study in diversity research (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-013-9300-0" target="_blank">Lee 2024</a>) has also found that
                female students do not really believe
                 it promotes gender diversity or understanding. Also, people's 
                 backgrounds (attending single-sex high schools, having members of
                  the opposite sex in their high school classes, having opposite-sex 
                  siblings at home, holding different religious beliefs, having interacted
                   with individuals of other genders, having engaged with 
                   non-traditional gender expressions, and having chosen gender 
                   studies courses) show no significant difference in their intention
                  to be in gender-inclusive housing. </p>
                  <blockquote class="highlight-quote">
                    This might indicate a negative perception of other genders
                     that needs to be tackled.

                <p> In light of these findings, it is more important than ever
                that we continue create welcome environments where students learn
                empathy and understanding of all humans. Institutions play a powerful role in
                 shaping how communities respond to difference, and when they 
                 lead with inclusive policies and visible support, they help set
                  a tone that encourages unity rather than division. Creating spaces for
                such interactions ensures a more equal community.

            <h3>Belongingness Across Scenarios</h3>
            <p>
              There are many different outcomes that would be effected by a change 
              in the rotation algorithm. We picked one to model: "belongingness".
              
              “Belongingness” is simply a measure of how many people in a student’s 
              house share an attribute of that student. For instance, if a student 
            is an athlete, we looked at the proportion of people in the student’s 
            House who are athletes, then threw that number into an equation, then 
            added the result to the student’s belongingness measure. </p>

            <p>The equation for measuring belongingness in the House was as follows:</p>
            <figure class="centered-figure">
              <img src="belonging-curve.png" alt="Belongingness Curve" />
            </figure>

            <p>The amount of belonging increases steeply then falls off exponentially. 
            This function was created based on the assumption that at least one hall
             full of people, which equates to 0.08 of a House,  was needed to make 
             people feel an adequate amount of belongingness. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <h3> Average Belonging Among the Categories</h3>
            <p>To the left are the average amounts of “Belongingness” for students 
              in each category. 

            <p>As we can see, students had a higher sense of belongingness when
              they were placed into a House they wanted (the Self-Selection scenario).</p> 
              
            <p>In the equalized scenario, where an equal amount of each demographic 
              group was placed in each House to maximize informal interactional 
              diversity, the scores were lower across the board.</p> 
  
            <p>Though in both scenarios, athletes had the most belongingness,
               followed by URMs, and queers. This is because the more of a particular
                demographic there is, the more of them will be present in each House,
                 even if they are equally spread among the Houses.

        <h3>Reflecting on our Process</h3>
        <p> 
          We were attempting to model an extremely complex system,
          which resulted in a lot of 
          assumptions and leaps in logic. Even after narrowing down our
          parameters, we attempt to assign values to factors 
          that are difficult to quantify, with many confounding variables. We
           had to cut down to only four demographic groups 
          that exist, and that these groups have very simple, stereotyped, Housing 
          preferences. In the process of building our model, we also experimented
           with adding more demographic groups and measuring different outcomes.
            Each variable we added (and attempted to add) helped us understand just
             how complicated of a system we are working with.</p> 
        <p> As such, our experiment should serve to make you think about how hard 
          it is to consider all of the implications that simple changes to the
           rotation algorithm might entail. More importantly, it shows the 
           difficulty of balancing the benefits of diversity, with the ethics 
           of placing people in a House they might not want.     
        </p>
        <h3> How Diversity Affects Society Past College </h3>
        <p>
          Pulled from diversity research, there are many positive effects from student
          diversity when done right. It ensures safe  and inclusive public spaces 
          past university, promoting gender-friendly cities and greater awareness
          of LGBTQIA+ spatial planning and queer spaces which is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development
             Goals (SDGs). 

        </p>
        <p>
          Armed with these insights, we consider how Caltech could leverage its
           data to create a more supportive environment for its students. 
           Worthwhile future work would strengthen the importance of fostering 
           an inclusive community through the Houses that supports students from all backgrounds.
